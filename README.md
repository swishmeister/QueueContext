# Queue Context

A League of Legends research pilot for **North American accounts**, starting with Llewellyn#300. Use the profile search to import another full Riot ID (Name#Tag). It compares the recent histories of your teammates and opponents across your latest 20 completed Ranked Solo/Duo games.

The first version is an exploratory dashboard, not a test that proves or disproves “losers queue.” Riot's internal MMR and matchmaking intent are not observable through this tool.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 22.13 or newer, pnpm, and Python 3.11 or newer. Python uses only its standard library. On this computer, the launcher can also use the bundled Codex Python runtime. Set `QUEUE_CONTEXT_PYTHON` to choose another Python executable.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5173**. Keep the launcher running; Ctrl+C stops both services. The dashboard uses port 5173 and the collector uses port 8766, both on loopback.

## Deploy on Render

The repository includes a Render Blueprint and Dockerfile that run the web app and Python collector as one password-protected web service.

1. In Render, select **New → Blueprint** and connect this repository.
2. Enter a strong value when Render prompts for `QUEUE_CONTEXT_PASSWORD`.
3. Apply the Blueprint and wait for the health check to pass.
4. Open the generated `onrender.com` URL. Sign in with username `queuecontext` and the password you entered.

The Blueprint uses Render's smallest paid web-service plan because this app needs a persistent disk for its SQLite match cache. The disk is mounted at `/var/data`; deployments and restarts therefore retain collected data. To use a different public hostname, set `QUEUE_CONTEXT_PUBLIC_URL` to its full HTTPS origin without a trailing slash.

Get a development key from the [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/), then open the **cog in the top right → Settings** and enter it in a masked API key field. Do not paste it into chat or commit it. The key stays in collector memory and must be entered again after a restart. Development keys expire after 24 hours.

Choose **Add keys**, close Settings, then **Refresh profile** (or search a Riot ID). Adding keys does not start network collection. A cold import with one key can take roughly 60–90 minutes under personal-key limits, depending on match overlap, API availability, and retries. Comparisons appear as histories finish. Pause and resume are supported; individual match records are saved immediately so they do not need to be downloaded again. Refreshing after new games reuses cached matches and records current ranks for newly encountered rosters and the latest roster.

## Multiple approved keys

This build supports up to 10 keys for the user’s Riot-approved multi-key setup. Riot’s standard [policy prohibits multiple applications to bypass limits](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/faqs); use pooling only within the approval granted for this product.

In Settings, select **Add another key** for more fields, then **Add keys**. You can add more later without re-entering existing keys. Identical keys count once. Pause the import before adding/removing keys; remove expired keys with their trash button. All credentials disappear on restart, while collected matches remain saved.

The single import dispatcher chooses the next key with available budget rather than waiting on one exhausted key. It keeps one shared match cache and chronological history pipeline, without concurrent duplicate downloads. Each key is paced at least 1.3 seconds apart per routing host, with additional waits for Riot’s application/method limits. Multiple keys reduce these pacing waits, but network latency and shared service limits still constrain throughput; speed does not necessarily scale linearly.

Application/method 429 responses cool down that key at the corresponding scope. Service or unspecified 429 responses cool down **every** key on that routing host. Expired/unknown keys are excluded while other keys continue; endpoint-specific access failures leave other endpoints available. Labels and session request totals are visible in Settings. Limits survive pause/resume and removing/re-adding the same key during the same process.

Riot player identifiers can differ between applications. Before importing, every key must return the same player identifier for a reference profile, matched against the saved cache. Incompatible keys are excluded so their match records cannot contaminate existing comparisons. Switching to keys with a different identifier namespace is not supported for the existing cache. If the reference Riot ID is renamed, the identity check will stop with an explanatory message rather than assume compatibility.

Multi-key behavior is verified with synthetic responses and a simulated clock, including shared cooldowns, rejection/failover, identifier compatibility, duplicate keys, pause behavior, and secret-free exports. Actual throughput still needs to be measured using the approved keys entered locally.

## Profile summary

The cards below the account show current rank, win rate over the displayed last 20 games, lobby average rank, and team history difference. Current rank uses the latest saved self-player rank observation and displays its timestamp. Lobby rank averages the available ranked player appearances across all ten players in each displayed game, including you; repeat players count once per appearance, and missing/unranked entries are excluded with coverage shown. The average uses the same 100 LP per division / shared Master+ scale as the match details. These are observed ranks, not reconstructed historical ranks. Team history difference uses only complete comparisons and shows how many are available.

## What it collects

- Your latest 20 available ranked Solo/Duo matches, excluding games shorter than three minutes as a remake approximation.
- For every participant, up to 20 eligible matches **completed before the shared match began**. Your own history is shown but excluded from teammate averages.
- Summoner icons from the shared match record and champion portraits mapped by champion ID to Riot Data Dragon 16.18.1 (catalogue in `lib/champion-icons.json`). Missing icons fall back to initials.
- Champion habits use complete prior 20-game windows: **One-trick pattern** = 16+ games; **Main pick** = most-played champion (ties allowed) with 6+ games; **Flex pick** = 1+ games otherwise; **First in 20** = zero games. Incomplete histories are unclassified. These are descriptive tags for the window, not lifetime mastery, proof of a one-trick account, or proof the player has never used the champion.
- Prior win rate, win/loss streak, champion/role familiarity, most-played role(s), and main-role/off-role tags. Ties share main-role status; missing histories are labeled. Support is displayed as Support.
- Team averages of observed rank include all five players, excluding missing/unranked records and showing coverage. Ranks are placed on a display scale with 100 LP per division, averaged, and rounded to the nearest LP. Apex tiers share a Master+ LP scale; this is not internal MMR or an official team rank.
- Summoner icons from Riot Data Dragon (asset version 16.18.1), using the selected summoner profile or latest cached match as a fallback.
- Duo controls sit in a compact expandable row below the player cards; the individual cards retain their duo badges.
- Duo labels per match: manually confirmed pairs, manual dismissals, and possible duos inferred from at least three earlier same-team matches present in both players’ available history windows. Suggestions never establish premade status, and no suggestion does not establish solo queue. The anchor match, future games and games as opponents are excluded. Manual labels persist in SQLite and exports, include their source/time, and can be cleared; clearing a dismissal restores any applicable suggestion. A player may have only one manually confirmed partner per match.
- Account level from the shared match record. Low account level is not treated as proof of a smurf.
- Optional current rank observations, timestamped when fetched. These are never represented as rank at the time of an older game.

The comparison is the mean prior win rate of **four teammates minus five opponents**, in percentage points. It appears only when all nine players have full histories. It is not a predicted win probability or a measure of skill. Missing or unavailable histories remain visible.

## Research limits

Twenty anchor games are enough to assess whether the interface and descriptive insights are useful. They are too few to establish matchmaking bias. Repeat players and overlapping histories create dependence, win rate has substantial sampling noise, and matching on hidden skill can generate patterns without intentional unfairness. Historical rank, internal MMR, party membership, and confirmed autofill are not inferred. No causal tests, statistical significance claims, or win-probability model are implemented. See docs/win-probability.md for the proposed research approach.

History queries inspect at most 400 prior IDs per participant per anchor. The anchor search inspects at most 200 IDs. Riot may not return older or unavailable records. Unknown records within a history keep that comparison incomplete instead of silently substituting older games. The under-three-minute rule may include some longer remakes or exclude unusually short legitimate matches.

## Data and security

SQLite data is stored in `data/queue-lab.sqlite3`, ignored by Git. It contains player identifiers and match records, so treat it as personal research data. **Export observations** downloads JSON with the visible comparisons and supporting history IDs. It does not include the API key or the complete raw match cache. The database retains all rank observations; the dashboard/export show the latest observation per player.

Keys are neither persisted nor returned by the API. Settings shows only generated labels, opaque removal IDs, status and session request counts; exports omit these settings as well. The collector validates its proxy origin and requires a per-process request token for changes. The Render gateway also requires HTTP Basic authentication. This remains a single-user application: only share the hosted username and password with someone you trust. Browser extensions, local programs, and developer tools with access to your session may still see information you enter.

## Development

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

`app/` contains the React dashboard, `collector/server.py` contains the Riot client, import job, SQLite store and local API, and `tests/` contains synthetic offline tests. Tests do not contact Riot or use real account records. The original account import has been verified with real data. Profile switching and the new summoner lookup are covered by offline fixtures; a live profile search requires reconnecting your key after this update. Profile changes preserve earlier profiles’ anchor lists and share the match cache.

Riot endpoints used: account-v1 by Riot ID and match-v5 on `americas`, and league-v4 entries and summoner-v4 by PUUID on `na1`. See the [official API reference](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis) and [rate-limit documentation](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal). The collector spaces requests conservatively per key and routing host, observes application/method limits and server counts, and handles HTTP 429 `Retry-After` responses.
